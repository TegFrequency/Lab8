The goal of this lab was to hash the files on the computer system.  I focused on my lab folder so I used the file path /home/tegtmeyer/labs

The hashes first get saved to hashes.cve
Once the hashes.cve file is made running the program will make the currenthashes.cve and compare it with hashes.cve
Only the hash values are compared.  Any differences are noted in the changes.txt
